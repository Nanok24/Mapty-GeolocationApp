# Mapty - Geolocation App

This is a demonstrative project where I learned how to use the geolocation API and how to use a 3rd party API (in this case, Leaflet) in a web project.

This project is also the first time I've used classes and used the OOP design philosophy, and I also learned how to work with localStorage.

### How to use the app

With Mapty you can keep track of your workouts. On start-up, you will need to allow Mapty to access your location through your browser settings.

Leaflet will then load the map, already centered for your location. You can click anywhere on the map to insert a pin by completing the information in the workout exercise form on the sidebar.

Once submitted, your workout pin will be saved on the map and you can navigate between different pins by clicking on the workout in the sidebar. All the data is nicely grouped and it's also stored with the help of localStorage, so the data isn't lost if you refresh the browser window.

### Credits

This is a project that was made during my learning process of JS, following Jonas Schmedtmann's (https://codingheroes.io/) course for javaScript. Credits to him for this idea and the provided structure.
